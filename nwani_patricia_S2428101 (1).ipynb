Scenario and Introduction\n","\n","**Company:** CloudGame Startup  \n","CloudGame Startup is a small indie game development company preparing to launch an online multiplayer web game. As a fast-growing team, they require scalable, cost-effective infrastructure to support unpredictable user traffic, secure data storage for player data, and efficient deployment using containers for continuous development and delivery.\n","###  What is Cloud Computing?\n","\n","Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (\"the cloud\") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.\n","\n","###  What is Virtualisation?\n","\n","Virtualisation is the foundational technology behind cloud computing. It involves creating virtual versions of physical components such as servers, storage devices, and networks. Using software called a **hypervisor**, a single physical server can host multiple virtual machines (VMs), each operating independently with its own operating system and applications. This improves hardware utilization, reduces costs, and allows for better scalability and disaster recovery.\n","\n","**Cloud Computing Overview:**  \n","Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources—like servers, storage, and networking—over the internet. It allows businesses to scale infrastructure dynamically while paying only for what they use. This is made possible through **virtualisation**, which simulates physical hardware and enables multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical system. Cloud services are generally offered in three layers:\n","\n","- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides raw computing power like virtual machines and storage (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs).\n","- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Offers tools and frameworks for developers to build and deploy applications without managing the infrastructure (e.g., Heroku, Google App Engine).\n","- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Delivers complete software solutions over the internet (e.g., Gmail, Trello, Office 365).\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ecIlogqfTTJN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"qVoDlZD3dPfI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2. Cloud Recommendations\n","\n","### **Cloud Service Model(s) and Usage**\n","- **Recommendation**: Use a combination of **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** and **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**.\n","- **Reasoning**:\n","  - **IaaS** (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine) provides scalable virtual machines for hosting game servers, allowing flexible infrastructure management.\n","  - **PaaS** (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine) simplifies application deployment, enabling developers to focus on coding without worrying about infrastructure setup.\n","\n","### **Cloud Patterns**\n","- **Microservices Architecture**: Breaking the web game into smaller independent services improves scalability and fault tolerance.\n","- **Containerization**: Using **Docker** and **Kubernetes** ensures efficient deployment and management of game servers across cloud environments.\n","- **Auto-scaling**: Ensures that resources scale automatically based on player demand, preventing downtime or excessive costs.\n","\n","### **Cloud Services and Usage**\n","- **Compute**: AWS EC2 instances with auto-scaling for game server deployment.\n","- **Storage**: AWS S3 for storing game assets, player data, and logs.\n","- **Database**:\n","  - AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) for structured player and transaction data.\n","  - AWS DynamoDB for storing real-time game state and session data.\n","- **Networking**: AWS CloudFront (CDN) for fast delivery of game content globally, reducing latency.\n","- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch for monitoring application performance and AWS GuardDuty for security threat detection.\n","\n","### **Key Issues in Cloud Computing**\n","- **Security**:\n","  - Implement Identity and Access Management (IAM) to restrict access based on roles.\n","  - Encrypt sensitive game and player data using AWS KMS (Key Management Service).\n","- **Cost Management**:\n","  - Use AWS Cost Explorer and budgeting tools to track expenses.\n","  - Opt for Reserved Instances and Spot Instances to optimize cloud spending.\n","- **Latency**:\n","  - Deploy game servers in multiple AWS Regions to reduce lag for players worldwide.\n","  - Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache and distribute static assets closer to users.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"byHuBtunvAkK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 3. Data Analysis and Visualisation\n","\n","\n","For CloudGame Startup, data analysis and visualisation can be highly beneficial in optimizing game server performance and enhancing user experience. By collecting and analyzing metrics such as server CPU usage, active users, and geographic regions, the team can identify performance bottlenecks and make informed decisions on scaling cloud resources.\n","\n","Below is a demonstration using a **Pandas DataFrame** to store sample data about server activity.
